<img src="/images/flashback.svg" alt="Roku Flashback Logo" width="200">

This version is simply to test implementing accessibility functionality for the Roku Flashback app.

## Retro Streaming Service

The Flashback app is part of the Roku streaming service. Subscribers can use this app to
access three separate flashback features; movies, television (tv) and music. Each of these three
sections are comprised exclusively of entertainment from 1950, 1960, 1970, 1980, and 1990
respectively.
