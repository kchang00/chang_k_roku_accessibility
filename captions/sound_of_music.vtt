00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.500
There is a family near Salzburg that needs a governess until September.

2
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
- September?

3
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
- To take care of seven children.

4
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Seven children?!

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.000
Come out of that water at once!

7
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.000
- Do you like children, Maria?

8
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.000
- Well yes, but seven? 

9
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I will tell Captain von Trapp to expect you tomorrow.

10
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
A Captain?

11
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
A retired officer of the Imperial Navy.

12
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.000
A fine man, and a brave one.

13
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Tell me, do you think the Captain would get me some more material if I asked him?

14
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.000
How many dresses does a governess need?

15
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.000
No, not for me. For the children.

16
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.000
I want to make them some play clothes.

17
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.000
The von Trapp children don't play. They march.

18
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.000
- But they're children!
- Yes. And I'm their father.

19
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.000
Goodnight.

20
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Do you mean to tell me 

21
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.000
that my children have been roaming about Salzburg 

22
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.000
dressed up in nothing but some old drapes?!

23
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.000
Mhm. And having a marvelous time.

24
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Fräulein... were you this much trouble at the Abbey?

26
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.000
Oh, much more, Sir.

27
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Why did they send you back to us?

28
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.000
They didn't send me back, Mother. I left.

29
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.000
Is it true Fräulein Maria isn't coming back? 

30
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.000
I can't face him again. 

31
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.000
There's nothing more irresistible to a man than a woman who's in love with him.

32
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.000
- In love with him?
- Of course.

33
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
T'what makes it so nice, is...

34
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.000
he thinks he's in love with you.

35
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Oh, there were times when we would look at each other.

36
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.000
Oh Mother, I could hardly breathe.

37
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
- Are you in love with him?

38
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.500
- I've never felt that way before.

39
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.500
Maria. You have to live the life you were born to live.

40
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And somewhere out there...

41
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.000
is a young lady, who I think... will never be a nun.
